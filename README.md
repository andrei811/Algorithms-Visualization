# Algorithms-Visualization

Welcome to Algorithm Visualization! I built this site, with algorithms because I love to see them in action and I think that's a good way to learn them :). I hope this is helpful and you will have fun watching the visualizations, as much as did coding it.

Attention! The site works well in Google Chrome.

## What algorithms you will find?
_Binary Search_ - Find an element in a sorted colection of elements in O(log(n))
_Selection Sort_ - Sorting 
_Bubble Sort_ - Sorting 
_Insertion Sort_ - Sorting
_Quick Sort_ - A fast sorting algorithm, based on Divide and Conquer Technique
_Lee Algorithm_ - BFS
